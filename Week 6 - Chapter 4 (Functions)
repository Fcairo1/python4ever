Example of the def function in Python
def is used to store commands under a name that we can call later to use the whole function.

Example:

def hello_people (): #defining what the hello_people command will store
    name=input ("Add your name: ")
    print ("hello, ", name)
    print ("How is your day going?")
    print ("do you need any coffee?")
    print ("Love you, bye!")
#all these commands are under the command hello_people. When we call it later, it will execute all these functions
hello_people () 

#The result of the code will be:
Add your name: xxxxxxx
hello,  xxxxxxx
How is your day going?
do you need any coffee?
Love you, bye!
