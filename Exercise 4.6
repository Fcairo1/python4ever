4.6 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. Pay should be the normal rate for hours up to 40 and time-and-a-half for the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. Put the logic to do the computation of pay in a function called computepay() and use the function to do the computation. The function should return a value. Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75). You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking the user input unless you want to - you can assume the user types numbers properly. Do not name your variable sum or use the sum() function.

def computepay(h, r):
    return 42.37

hrs = input("Enter Hours:")
p = computepay(10, 20)
print("Pay", p)


------ This is the exercise, now my answer:
#MY FIRST ATTEMPT#
def computepay(h, r):
    if h>40:
        p= ((h-40)*1.5*r)+(40*r)
    else:
        p= 40*r
    print (p)
    
hrs = input("Enter Hours:")
h= float (hrs)
rate= input ("Enter rate:")
r=float(rate)
p = computepay(h, r)

#It WORKS, BUT THE EXERCISE WANTS ME TO USE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS. It wants me to use Return () in the def function. So, the second attempt is:
#SECOND ATTEMPT (THE SITE ACCEPTED AS CORRECT!)

def computepay(h, r):                      
    if h>40:
        p= ((h-40)*1.5*r)+(40*r)                    #calculations IF hours above 40
    else:
        p= h*r                                      
    return (p)

    
hrs = input("Enter Hours:")
h= float (hrs)
rate= input ("Enter rate:")
r=float(rate)
p = computepay(h, r)
print ("Pay", p)
